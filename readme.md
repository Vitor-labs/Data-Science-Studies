## <center>MACHINE LEARNING COURSE</center>
----
Field of inquiry devoted to understanding and building methods that 'learn', that is, methods that leverage data to improve performance on some set of tasks. 

_"A program is said to learn from experience E, with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if it's performance on T, as measured by P improves with experience E."_. ~ Tom Mitchell, 1997.

### **Types of Machine Learning Algorithms** :
- **Supervised** - the algorithm are feeded with data, which are  <span style="color:MediumSeaGreen"> labeled and we know what our output</span> should like having the relationship betweem input X and output y.

    - Regression - for continuous and quantitative data. 
  
    - Classification - for categorical / qualitative data.
  
    - Common Algorithims: Linear regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines.

| Basic                        | The mapping function is used for mapping values to predefined classes. | Mapping Function is used for the mapping of values to continuous output. |
| Involves prediction of       | Discrete values                                                        | Continuous values                                                        |
| Nature of the predicted data | Unordered                                                              | Ordered                                                                  |
| Method of calculation        | by measuring accuracy                                                  | by measurement of root mean square error                                 |

-  **Semi-Supervised** - is a special instance of weak supervision that combines a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data during training. 

- **Unsupervised** - the algorithm are feeded with <span style="color:MediumSeaGreen"> not labeled data and the output and relationships are also unknown</span>, we have to recognize patterns on the data.

    - Clustering - aims to group the data into certain sets that are distinct from each other.
  
    - Common Algorithims: K-Means, Apriori, Hierarchical Clustering.

- **Reinfocement** - agent learning in interactive environment based on rewards and penalities, the agent is allowed to determine the ideal behavior to maximize its performance.
