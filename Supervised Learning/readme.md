# Supervised Learning

here the algorithm learns from **labelled data** and tries to map patterns. The main types of Supervised Learnig are Classification and Regression. 
  - Classification is about prediction of classes and discrete values. Some famous algorithms:
    1. Decision Trees
    2. Random Forest
    3. K-Nearest Neighbor
  - Regression is about predicting quantities and continuous values. Some famous algorithms:
    1. Logistic Regression
    2. Polynomial Regression
    3. Support Vector Machines

A third type can be apointed, Ranking:
  - uses labeled datasets to train its data and models to classify future data to predict outcomes, sorting data in a relevant order.
