# Linear Algebra Summary

Linear algebra deals with vectors, matrices, and linear transformations. It provides a powerful framework for solving systems of linear equations and analyzing geometric transformations.

[Key Concepts](#key-concepts)

## Key Concepts:

1. Vectors and Scalars: Vectors represent quantities with both magnitude and direction, while scalars are single numerical values. Vectors can be added, subtracted, and scaled.

2. Vector Spaces: A vector space is a set of vectors that satisfy specific properties, including closure under addition and scalar multiplication.

3. Matrices and Matrix Operations: Matrices are rectangular arrays of numbers. Common operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and transpose.

4. Linear Transformations: These are functions that map vectors from one vector space to another while preserving linear relationships. They play a crucial role in geometry and computer graphics.

5. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors: Eigenvalues are scalars that represent how a linear transformation stretches or shrinks a vector. Eigenvectors are the corresponding non-zero vectors.

6. Matrix Decompositions:
    6.1. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD): Expresses a matrix as a product of three matrices, aiding in dimensionality reduction and data compression.
    
    6.2. Eigenvalue Decomposition: Represents a matrix as a product of its eigenvectors and a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues.

7. Dot Product and Inner Product: The dot product measures the similarity between two vectors, and the inner product generalizes this concept to more abstract vector spaces.

8. Orthogonality: Orthogonal vectors are perpendicular to each other, and an orthogonal basis simplifies vector calculations.

9. Span and Linear Independence: A set of vectors spans a space if any vector in the space can be expressed as a linear combination of the set's vectors. Linearly independent vectors are not redundant.
