# Unsupervised Learning

here the algorithm learns from **Unlabelled Data** and tries to map patterns. The primary goal of unsupervised learning is to find meaningful representations or groupings in the data. 
    * This is particularly useful when the task is to explore and understand the underlying structure of the data or when labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain.

Common applications of unsupervised learning include:

1. Clustering: the algorithm groups similar data points together based on their inherent similarities.

2. Dimensionality reduction: High-dimensional data can be difficult to visualize and analyze, the algorithms are used to reduce the number of features while retaining the most relevant information.
   - This helps in visualizing and understanding complex data and can also improve the efficiency of subsequent learning algorithms.

3. Anomaly detection: By learning the normal behavior of the data, the algorithm can detect instances that deviate significantly from the expected patterns.

4. Generative modeling: Unsupervised learning methods can be used to generate new data samples that resemble the training data distribution. 

5. Density estimation: Involves modeling the probability distribution of the data to understand how likely different data points are in certain regions of the feature space.
   - useful for modeling uncertainty and making probabilistic predictions.
