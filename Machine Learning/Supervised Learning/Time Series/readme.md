**Time Series**: *Sequencial infromation which attaches a time period to each value.*

<p>
 Most commonly, a time series is a sequence taken at successive equally spaced points in time, measured by a frequency. Thus it is a sequence of discrete-time data.

 Time series data are also time dependent, this means that the values for every period are affected by outside factors and by the values of past periods

 Also other factor that affects time-series data is seasonality, this means that some changes can be antecipated. But this is no often observed in regular data
</p>

* intervals need to be identical.
* pattens observed in time-series are expected to persist in the future

**Time series analysis**: comprises methods for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data. 

__Time series forecasting__: is the use of a model to predict future values based on previously observed values.
