Probability is the measure of the likelihood of an event occurring. It is used to predict the outcomes of uncertain events. Probability is expressed as a number between 0 and 1, where 0 means the event is impossible, and 1 means the event is certain. The three main types of probability are:

**<u>Theoretical Probability:</u>** This is the probability based on mathematical calculations. If all outcomes are equally likely to occur, then $ P(E) $, the probability that $ E $ occurs is given by:
$$
    P(E) = \frac{n(E)}{n(S)}
$$
* where $ n(E) $ is the number of outcomes in the event and $ n(S) $ is the number of outcomes in the sample space.

**<u>Empirical Probability:</u>** This is the probability based on actual experiments or observations. If $ E $ is an event, the $ P(E) $, the probability that $ E $ occurs, is given by:
$$
    P(E) = \frac{f}{n}
$$ 
* where $ f $ is the frequency of event $ E $ and $ n $ is the total number of times the experiment is performed.

**<u>Subjective Probability:</u>** This is the probability based on personal beliefs or judgments. 

### Basic rules of probability:

- The sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes is 1.
- The probability of an event not occurring is 1 minus the probability of the event occurring.
- The probability of two independent events occurring together is the product of their individual probabilities.
- The probability of either of two mutually exclusive events occurring is the sum of their individual probabilities.

### Properties of Probability:
1. For any event, $ E, 0 \le P(E) \le 1 $
2. For any sample space, $ S, P(S) = 1 $
3. For the empty set, $ \emptyset, P(\emptyset) = 0 $

### The Complement:
the complement of an event $ E $, denoted $ E^c $, is the set of all outcomes in the sample space that are not in $ E $.

* Complement rule for Probability: The sum of the probabilities of an event, $ E $, and its complement, $ E^c $, is equal to one. $ P(E) + P(E^c) = 1 $.
* Addition rule for Probability: For two events, $ E $, and $ F $, the probability that $ E $ or $ F $ occurs is given by: $ P(E or F) = P(E) + P(F) - P(E and F) $.

### Mutually Exclusive Events:
two events, $ E $ and $ F $, are said to be mutually exclusive events if they do not have any outcomes in common.

* Addition rule for Probability of Mutually Exclusive Events: if two events, $ E $, and $ F $, are Mutually Exclusive, then the probability that $ E $ or $ F $ occurs is given by: $ P(E or F) = P(E) + P(F) - P(E and F) $.
