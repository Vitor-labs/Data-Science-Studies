### <u>Frequecy Distributions </u>:
is a display og the values that occur in a data set and how often each value, or range of values, occurs.

* Frequencies ( _f_ ): are the numbers of data values in the categories of a frequecy distribution table.
* Class: is a category of data in a requecy distribution.
* Relative Frequecy: is the fraction of the data set that falls into a particular class. Given by:
  $$
    \frac{f}{n}
    $$
  * where: f = class frequency, n is the sample size, given by n = $ \sum{f_i} $, and $ f_i $ is the frequency of the $ i^{th} $ class.
* Cumulative frequency: is the sum of the frequencies of a given class and all previous classes.
  

### <u>Probability Distributions </u>:
is a theoretical distribution used to predict the probabilities of particular data values occurring in a population.

1. Decide how many classes should be in the distribution.
2. Choose an appropriate class width.
   * one way to do it is subtracting the lowest number in the data set from the highest and dividing the diferrence by the number of classes. Such as:
    $$
        \frac{(H - L)}{C}
    $$
3. Find the class limits. respectively the smallest and largest numbers that can belong to a class.
   * choose the first lower limit so that reasonable classses will be produced.
   * it should have the same decimal places as the largest number decimal places in the data.
4. Determine the frequency of each class. 
   * make a tally mark for each data value in the appropriate class, count the marks to find the total frequency for each class.

## Glossary:

1. _'Distribution'_: is a way to describe the structure of a particular data set or population.
2. _'Class width'_: the difference between the lower and upper limits of two consecutive classes.
   1. _'lower class limit'_: the smallest number that can belong to a particular class.
   2. _'upper class limit'_: the largest number that can belong to a particular class.
3. _'class boundary'_: is the value that lies halfway berween the limits of two classes
