# Life Cycle of a Data Science Project

Following the CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) framework, that consists of a set of good practices (aka methodology) to execute a project in Data Science.

The CRISP-DM methodology consists of six main phases:

1. ## Business Understanding:
    This initial phase involves understanding the project objectives, requirements, and business goals. It aims to clarify the specific problems that need to be solved and how data mining can contribute to achieving those goals.

2. ## Data Understanding:
    now, data scientists gather and explore the available data to gain insights into its structure, quality, and potential usefulness for the project. This step helps in identifying data issues and deciding which data is relevant for the analysis.

3. ## Data Preparation:
    This phase focuses on data cleaning, transformation, and integration. Data scientists perform tasks like handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and creating derived features to ensure that the data is ready for modeling.

4. ## Modeling:
    The modeling phase is where data scientists apply various data mining techniques to build and evaluate predictive or descriptive models. Different algorithms are tested and tuned to identify the most suitable one for the problem at hand.

5. ## Evaluation:
    here, the performance of the models is assessed using validation techniques such as cross-validation or hold-out samples. The goal is to select the best-performing model that meets the project's requirements.

6. ## Deployment:
    The final phase involves deploying the chosen model into the production environment, making it available for end-users to make predictions or decisions. It also includes documenting the process and results to facilitate future maintenance and improvements.

The CRISP-DM metodology is focused on Data Mining projects

## **Data Mining** :  
The action of process data to gain patterns, and to gain knowledge on that pattern. In the process of data mining, large data sets are first sorted, then patterns are identified and relationships are established to perform data analysis and solve problems.

* Data Mining is divided in some areas:

for the specific development of machine learning applications, an evolution of the methodology was made, the CRISP-ML(Q) framework. Stands for Cross Industry Standard Process for Machine Learning with Quality assurance.

CRISP-ML(Q) is implemented with 6 stages as follows:

1. Business and Data Understanding
2. Data Preparation
3. Model Building and Tuning
4. Evaluation
5. Model Deployment
6. Monitoring and Maintenance
